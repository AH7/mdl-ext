A lightboard, also known as a lightbox, is a translucent surface illuminated from behind, used for 
situations where a shape laid upon the surface needs to be seen with high contrast. In the "old days" 
of photography photograpers used a lightboard to get a quick view of, sorting and organizing their slides.
