**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Components based on the Google Material Design Lite framework.

Material Design is a design language developed by Google. Expanding upon the "card" motifs 
that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and 
transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript 
frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible.


## Components

### Select Element Component
![Select Elemenent Component](./etc/select-element.png)

The HTML ```<select>``` element represents a control that presents a menu of options. Material Design Lite 
does not provide it's own component for the ```<select>``` element.

Credits: The Select component is based on the following sources:
* [Material Design Lite selectfield component](https://github.com/mebibou/mdl-selectfield) 
* [mdl-selectfield](https://github.com/MEYVN-digital/mdl-selectfield)
