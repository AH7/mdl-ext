Components based on the Google Material Design Lite framework

Material Design is a design language developed by Google. Expanding upon the "card" motifs 
that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and 
transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript 
frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use,  and offer an experience that is immediately accessible


## Components

### Accordion Component
![Accordion Component](./etc/flexbox-accordion.png)

An accordion component is a collection of expandable panels associated with a common outer container. Panels consist of 
a header and an associated content region or panel. The primary use of an Accordion is to present multiple sections of 
content on a single page without scrolling, where all of the sections are peers in the application or object hierarchy. 
The general look is similar to a tree where each root tree node is an expandable accordion header. The user navigates 
and makes the contents of each panel visible (or not) by interacting with the Accordion Header.

### Select Element Component

The HTML ```<select>``` element represents a control that presents a menu of options. MDL does not provide it's own 
component for the ```<select>``` element.

Credits: The Select component is based on the following sources:
* [Material Design Lite selectfield component](https://github.com/mebibou/mdl-selectfield) 
* [mdl-selectfield](https://github.com/MEYVN-digital/mdl-selectfield)
* [Simple Material Design Login, with select field](http://codepen.io/michaelschofield/pen/qEzWaM)
* [Material Design &lt;select&gt; element, css only](http://codepen.io/pudgereyem/pen/PqBxQx)
